# iirj
An IIR filter library written in JAVA.

Filters: Butterworth, Elliptic (Cauer) and Chebyshev Type I

It's based on the IIR1 library: https://github.com/berndporr/iir1

## Dependencies
You need the Apache Commons Math libraries from here:

http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/index.html

## Usage

### Init
Butterworth butterworth = new Butterworth();

### Bandstop
butterworth.bandStop(order,Samplingfreq,Center freq,Width in frequ);

### Bandpass
butterworth.bandPass(order,Samplingfreq,Center freq,Width in frequ);

### Lowpass
butterworth.lowPass(order,Samplingfreq,Cutoff frequ);

### Highpass
butterworth.highPass(order,Samplingfreq,Cutoff frequ);

### Filtering
sample by sample for realtime processing:

v = butterworth.filter(v)

See the Test*.java files for a complete examples.
You can run them easily from eclipse or the commandline.
These test programs write the impulse responses of the
filters to text files which you can then plot with
the octave script filtertest.m

Have fun
